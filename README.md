# Santa-Workshop-Scheduling

This analysis uses optimization (Julia, JuMP, Gurobi) to schedule tours to Santa's Workshop such that all families are accommodated and their date preferences are considered. 

This was part of the Kaggle Challenge "Santa's Workshop Tour 2019". The dataset and more details about the problem can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/overview

Each of the Julia files represents a variation on the optimization formulation for this problem. The Python file includes a simulated annealing approach.
